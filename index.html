				<h3>Subheading</h3>
					<p>Growing up in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, I had the privilege of experiencing life in its simplest form. From noon until sunset, I would play outside with my cousins in the vast green flatlands at our summer house. Back then, the idea of staying confined to a room or an item for hours was unthinkable. We were free.
					Today, however, we find ourselves chained to technology. While I recognize that technology has helped me in my journey to find opportunities, its original intention—to connect the world and improve lives—feels lost. Over the past two decades, we’ve traded our humanity for the comfort and convenience that technology provides, sinking deeper into a cycle of dependency.</p>
					<p>Tech companies have spent years leveraging the expertise of product designers and researchers to create seamless, and invisible designs that quietly integrate into our daily routines. Before you know it, you can’t imagine life without a certain app, gadget, or widget—as if your reliance had always been there.
					In the name of good design, humans have created an addiction machine that controls the mind, like a factory. The bigger problem is that the addiction is now global. It took less than a few years for people, regardless of culture or race, to almost lose their identities and have the same vision of life. Almost everyone now wants to be a tech millionaire or an overnight sensation with millions of Instagram followers. It is a pandemic of minds.</p>
					<p>A few days ago, I came across a talk by Jensen Huang, the founder and CEO of Nvidia. In his speech, he shares a terrifying plan: AI is going to replace software developers, reshaping the tech industry by automating tasks once performed by humans. To my surprise, when I told them about the speech, my friend made a gloomy remark <em>"…That's expected, what can we do about it?"</em>
					Is that it? Are we truly powerless as we slowly give away our humanity to technology? Why do we blindly adapt to every technological advancement, prioritizing convenience over everything else? This submission to technological dominance isn't just a problem for users—it's a dilemma for designers creating these technologies.</p>
					<p>As a product designer, one of the first user experience books I read was <em>Don't Make Me Think</em> by Steve Krug. I was fascinated by the idea of creating seamless experiences so intuitive that users don't realize every detail was made with an intention behind them. However, this realization also came with a darker truth: in design, nothing is accidental. Every feature and interaction is made with a purpose.
					This means that the endless scrolling, the addictive nature, and the toll on mental health many digital products cause are not by chance—they were intentionally designed to keep the cycle going. Why? Because your lack of social life, insecurities, compulsive disorders, loneliness, and misery bring them money. Almost all tech products, unless non-profit, are created to serve the interests of the companies behind them, not the users.</p>
					<p>In his article <em>The Invisible Details of Interaction Design,</em> Rauno Freiberg highlights the seamless user experience of the iPhone, which draws inspiration from natural human behaviors like fidgeting. While I find the effort of Apple’s designers put into researching human behavior impressive, it also prompted me to reflect on the ethical responsibilities that come with design. As a design graduate student in a class of twenty-seven aspiring product designers, I noticed that many of my classmates also value the concept of invisible usability in design:</p>
					<p class="main-micro-response"></p>
					<p>Looking at my classmates' micro-responses on invisibility in design makes me question: How can we use our ‘invisibility cloak’ to guide technology in a more humane direction? One answer might be to stop underestimating our power. As product designers, we are not just mindless labor of tech companies—we have a voice. It’s crucial to use that voice, just as my classmates are now doing by sharing their thoughts through these essays for this project. Designers must actively advocate for ethical practices. To steer technology in a more humane direction, designers can prioritize transparency and accountability, build products that promote mindful use, and advocate for ethical guidelines within their organizations. Additionally, individuals aspiring to work in the tech industry should familiarize themselves with latest tech trends as well as foundations, engage in conversations, and most importantly remember that technological advancement is not always a human advancement.</p>
