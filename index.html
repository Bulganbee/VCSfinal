		<article>
			<div class="section">
					<p>Growing up in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, I had the privilege of experiencing life in its simplest form. From noon until sunset, I would play outside with my cousins in the vast green flatlands at our summer house. Back then, the idea of staying confined to a room or an item for hours was unthinkable. We were free.
					Today, however, we find ourselves chained to technology. While I recognize that technology has helped me in my journey to find opportunities, its original intention—to connect the world and improve lives—feels lost. Over the past two decades, we’ve traded our humanity for the comfort and convenience that technology provides, sinking deeper into a cycle of dependency.</p>
					<p>Tech companies have spent years leveraging the expertise of product designers and researchers to create seamless, and invisible designs that quietly integrate into our daily routines. Before you know it, <mark> you can’t imagine life without a certain app, gadget, or widget—as if your reliance had always been there.</mark>
					In the name of good design, humans have created an addiction machine. The bigger problem is that the addiction is now global. It took less than a few years for people, regardless of culture or race, to lose their individuality. It is a pandemic of minds.</p>
					<p>A few days ago, I came across a talk by Jensen Huang, the founder and CEO of Nvidia. In his speech, he shares a terrifying plan: AI is going to replace software developers, reshaping the tech industry by automating tasks once performed by humans. To my surprise, when I told them about the speech, my friend made a gloomy remark <em>"…That's expected, what can we do about it?"</em>
					Is that it? <mark>Are we truly powerless as we slowly give away our humanity to technology?</mark> Why do we blindly adapt to every technological advancement, prioritizing convenience over everything else? This submission to technological dominance isn't just a problem for users—it's a dilemma for designers creating these technologies.</p>
					<p>As a product designer, one of the first user experience books I read was <i>Don't Make Me Think</i> by Steve Krug. I was fascinated by the idea of creating seamless experiences so intuitive that users don't realize every detail was made with an intention behind them. However, this realization also came with a darker truth: in design, nothing is accidental. Every feature and interaction is made with a purpose.
					This means that <mark>the endless scrolling, the addictive nature, and the toll on mental health many digital products cause are not by chance—they were intentionally designed to keep the cycle going.</mark> Why? Because your lack of social life, insecurities, mental disorders, loneliness, and misery bring them money. Almost all tech products, unless non-profit, are created to serve the interests of the companies behind them, not the users.</p>
					<p>In his article <em>The Invisible Details of Interaction Design,</em> Rauno Freiberg highlights the seamless user experience of the iPhone, which draws inspiration from natural human behaviors like fidgeting. While I find the effort of Apple’s designers impressive, it also prompted me to reflect on the ethical responsibilities that come with design. As a design graduate student in a class of twenty-seven aspiring product designers, I noticed that many of my classmates also value the concept of invisible usability in design:</p>

					<p>Looking at my classmates' micro-responses on invisibility in design makes me question: How can we use our ‘invisibility cloak’ to guide technology in a more humane direction? One answer might be to stop underestimating our power. As product designers, we are not just mindless labor of tech companies—we have a voice. It’s crucial to use that voice, just as my classmates are now doing by sharing their thoughts through these essays for this project. Designers must actively advocate for ethical practices. <mark>To steer technology in a more humane direction, designers can prioritize transparency and accountability, build products that promote mindful use, and advocate for ethical guidelines within their organizations.</mark> Additionally, individuals aspiring to work in the tech industry should familiarize themselves with latest tech trends as well as foundations, engage in conversations, and most importantly remember that technological advancement is not always a human advancement.</p>

		<p class="microresponse-drop"> &#9679; "All of the biggest and most brilliant design ideas have always come from the little things. So, as designers, we should carefully observe everything as much as we can. Otherwise, we might miss significant opportunities in future designs."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop"> &#9679; "This is an example-based article. I like how designers reflect and optimize their design based on the needs of users they find in their daily lives. Communication function should always be the primary consideration in design."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop"> &#9679; "Reflecting on Hara’s insights, I view design as a profound journey that begins with humanity’s earliest use of tools, transforming simple objects into complex creations through intellect. True creativity, as Hara suggests, blends diverse cultural wisdom with modern thought, highlighting that design is not just about the creating latest innovations but also about preserving subtle, often overlooked rich values from the past amid ongoing technological and societal changes."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "This statement highlights that modern designers are discovering that creativity and innovation are not limited to new technologies but can also be found in the everyday aspects of our lives. In other words, there are endless design possibilities in the familiar and routine, just as much as in technological advancements. By exploring and reimagining the ordinary, designers can uncover fresh and impactful solutions."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "In an article given by our professor in Major 1, I thought it was interesting to have a workshop called Bodystorming where you go where the users are - for example, if your user is a student, you will go to campus and if your user is a barista, you will go to cafe. Understanding what the users are experiencing allows you to see why they are struggling and where there are opportunities for improvement."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "This reminds me of what Bee and Devansh said in our seminar last week; good user experience design should be invisible, while art should be seen. If the user is able to complete the task without any errors and minimal instruction, then we as designers have done our job correctly. The opposite of good design is the Norman Door, where you need instructions for a simple task like opening a door."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "As designers, our goal should go beyond making the user experience more intuitive or user-friendly; we should work towards making technology feel natural not intimidating. We need to design in a way that allows people to navigate apps as easily as they would explore their environment or learn from a book. We should always focus on designing for people, not just users, by creating experiences that feel human-centered."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "Design is deeply rooted in human sensory perception and daily experiences, which machines alone cannot fully replicate. While machines can handle the technical aspects of production, they lack the emotional depth. The delicate balance of aesthetics often comes from a human sensory—an understanding of context, culture, and personal experience that machines can't fully range. Therefore, while machines can be invaluable tools in the design process, they should complement rather than replace the human element."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "This quote resonated with me as it echoed last class' discussion, where many of us highlighted that designers differ from artists because we design with a solution in mind and our designs are always fact / researched based. This quote is particularly relevant to our core studio class, as we are focusing on usability and utility. I believe that this passage is important for us because As UX designers, our primary responsibility is to ensure that our products are not only aesthetically pleasing but, more importantly, usable and user-centered."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "Designers are not only creators of aesthetics, but also mediators of information transfer. A basic stock of specialized knowledge is necessary, and designers are an important bridge between clients and the public, and need to find a balance between skills and aesthetics, not only to convey information, but also to touch the hearts of viewers in an appropriate way."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "It is really interesting that the author compares typography to a crystal goblet. I agree with the idea that type should be invisible yet still effectively convey its message. Additionally, I believe that all good design should be invisible; it may not be noticed by users, but it quietly enhances the user experience, making it better and more convenient."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "Bodystorming is a very useful concept and I just realized that I always use this method when packing luggage to make sure I have everything I need. Similarly, when I do branding design of a unfamiliar field, I can use role play to simulate users' behavior ,get real information, and adjust my designs accordingly."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "The video about Norman Doors illustrates the principle that "good design is invisible." When a design functions smoothly, users hardly notice it, but poor design becomes visible when errors occur. The example of bad doors in the video highlights how a lack of discoverability leaves users confused whether to perform a push or pull action. Similarly, in interface design, it's crucial for users to discover by themself how to interact with the product without confusion or errors."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "From the article, I understand that interaction is an important way to connect the real world with digital experience. When we start a UI design, we should focus on the system that should notify user of what is happening or the current status through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time. We should enable user to understand the current status, location, success, and progress, reducing uncertainty, and guide them to interact in the right direction, rather than wasting time on repetitive operations. We need to provide convenient ways for users to familiarize themselves with and use web pages or application more quickly."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "It was difficult to choose a passage from the video I wanted to respond to, because the whole thing was endlessly fascinating to me, but I settled on this one because I believe it captures its thesis the best: the human brain operates in metaphors, and they’re how we make sense of the abstract world around us. This notion, in its essence, informs the fundamental challenge of UX design: how could one concretize an intangible digital space? The whole UX process involves identifying these patterns of thinking to lead to design decisions that would enable the brain to make easy connections when navigating digital platforms. Metaphors are the reason why certain icons are ascribed to certain features, why software functionalities are categorized in specific ways, why a sense of physicality is present in websites and apps (e.g. inbox), and so much more."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "Good design is something that needs no explanation. It seamlessly adapts to its surroundings and stands out only when intended."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "This quote really resonated with me as I think that sometimes we overlook typography or undermine the visual power it has, but it is truly a very important aspect of all design work, from illustration, to graphic design, to web design...etc. It is very interesting to me to look at typography from a UX perspective instead of just a graphic design perspective because I think this quote is even more applicable to ux work. it definitely relates to usability because good usability is silent, and feels very natural."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "It’s fascinating to realize that something like playing with an Apple Pencil was intentional design. Thought was given to its weight and body making it more than just a tool. To create a memory with the interaction and in turn a sense of familiarity is such strong sense of design. Designing everything with subtle elements to breed familiarity and so much intent would provide such satisfaction to the person using it."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "Swiping up and swiping up all that way - there's such a small difference between these actions, however in most cases it's either going to go unnoticed or give some a sign of relief. The article reminded me of a particular product launch that I often revisit every once in a while, the launch of the original iPhone back in 2007. When Jobs introduced this product, he started with introducing it with it's "revolutionary UI". What was so revolutionary and unique about it? Jobs then proceeds to introduce 'Multi-Touch'. It's mind blowing to think about the fact that we still us all the skeuomorphic gestures that Apple introduced almost two decades ago and will probably continue using for years to come. It shows us how some amount of though can influence our behaviors and over time becoming second nature to us."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "I pieced the quote above to encapsulate the main takeaway I had from this article. Becoming a UX designer, it is important to understand how a user will naturally behave to not be more disruptive during the completion of tasks. It’s exciting to know that in this industry, there will be a time where digital interactions will move beyond the bounds of screens. Until then, it is important to continue to practice the intersection of natural occurrences within the digital experiences we create."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "20. 
			21. *Rauno Freiberg’s “Invisible Details of Interaction Design” gives me an refreshing view of how the commonly-followed hand gestures in interaction design are developed and why good interaction design should be modeled after properties of the real world. It was particularly interesting to learn about “implicit input”, as having input based on context and infer users’ intention gives users a magical experience. In my opinion, “implicit input” is essentially thinking one step ahead of users. That is, to analyze usage scenario and user flow then infer what do users normally do prior to completing a task. For example, WeChat (China’s largest messaging app) has this image preview function when sending images/videos in chat. That is, if users are detected to save an image to their album right before clicking on sending image function in WeChat, WeChat will automatically show a preview of the recently saved image, inferring that is the image users intend to send. It is exactly this kind of “implicit input” that makes users think this app really understands them and encourages them to continue using it.*"</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "I’ve always been a natural problem solver, and I approach just about everything that way. I love diving into different experiences to figure out their purpose and how they solve problems. I’m constantly reflecting on my interactions with technology and apps, and as a user, I ask myself—was something missing? If I spot something, I immediately make a note. Figuring out the 'how' and 'why' behind things keeps me motivated and helps me grow as a digital product designer.Apple’s interactions have always fascinated me because they feel so smooth and intuitive. Understanding how users interact with interfaces highlights the importance of user behavior and psychology. As designers, we need to think not just about how users interact with a product, but also why they do.I might be a little late to the party, but I just learned about Dynamic Island, introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro. After reading more about it, I think it’s such a clever feature that enhances usability, improves multitasking, and turns what could have been a design limitation into a unique, interactive tool!"</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "The text explains that not every interaction in design is focused on functionality; some aim to meet emotional or psychological needs. For example, fidgeting actions like tapping a pencil help people handle stress or stay focused. This suggests that interaction design can intentionally include these kinds of behaviors to make users feel more comfortable. The passage also emphasizes that design should, at times, prioritize user relaxation and emotional well-being instead of always aiming for efficiency. It encourages a more user-centered design approach that considers deeper psychological needs."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "If we are trying to always recreate the real-world feeling in the digital space, will we ever have its own unique experience? What about experiences/animations/interactions just unique to digital products? And will repeated action make it just “feel right”?Another great example of something that comes close to my mind after reading this is the experience of being on a kindle; I got a Kindle back in 2015 when digital products weren’t this smooth with interactions, yet every little interaction I had with the Kindle (whether the interactions were real-world inspired or just very well thought out) made the experience so much better, even with the limitations of no external input it possesses."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "This article presents interesting approaches to interactive actions with computers and phones. It was impressive to learn that all interactions originate from the real world, with principles derived from actual human body movements. The author provided many examples of interactive apps that I currently use, which intrigued me, and I tested some of their functions. Most interfaces and icons are designed with user performance and instinctive behaviors in mind for convenience. When creating something, we should consider not only aesthetics but also interactive functionality and practical efficiency."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "The text talks about how using a mouse or keyboard feels less connected to what’s happening on the screen compared to directly touching the screen. when you touch the screen, it feels more natural, so animations can be more important. The main point is that designers should think about the kind of interaction when deciding if they need to add animations or not."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "I really like the swipe gesture in mobile apps. For example, I just need to swipe left if I want to go back to the previous page (or layer), which imitates the real physical world, so interaction design is actually pursuing familiarity. This recalls me of one of my previous reading"The Crystal Goblet, or Printing Should Be Invisible", good interactive design is invisible.What I learned from this reading is that designer should not add interactive animation to every action--it depends. I always assume that all buttons/options need an animation because this is my job as a designer. But if it is an option that needs to be clicked frequently, the designer should not use long-duration animation, so users feel that their thoughts and actions are more synchronized, making the operation on the screen more like an extension of the user's body.In short, I think from the designer's perspective, design is about thinking and testing; but from the user's perspective, design is perception."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "Understanding that real-world objects are in a constant state of motion and influenced by our actions is a powerful insight from Chan. As an iPhone user, I have never faced any difficulties using its user interface (despite constant updates); it has always felt very natural. The concept of 'working with behavior rather than animation' resonates deeply with me and has shifted my perspective on interface design, including the previous reading. After watching the video, I realized that the world is quite literally at your fingertips."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "During our Major Studio 1 class, Clara said that when you design for everyone, you design for no one. Growing up in a high-context Asian American household while being part of a low-context community has made me more aware of how different cultures interpret information. This experience helps me prioritize inclusivity in my design process, ensuring I create work considering diverse communication styles and cultural perspectives."</p>
		<p class="microresponse-drop">&#9679; "Author emphasis on the importance of understanding history reminds readers that the future is often shaped by the past. Past experiences can have a profound impact on a person's future behavior, mental health, and attitude towards life. For example, if a person has experienced a traumatic event, they may exhibit psychological problems such as anxiety and depression in their future life. In addition, past experiences can also affect a person's expectations and confidence in the future. So, the lessons learned from the past have immeasurable value in addressing the complexity of human behavior and social evolution."</p>
